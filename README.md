This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1 - Datadog RUM: Add RUM Client Token and Application ID to a ```.env``` File

First, you will need to create a React Native RUM application in Datadog: https://app.datadoghq.com/rum/application/create. Once the application is created, take note of the client token and application ID for the RUM application:

![Datadog RUM Application Config](https://a.cl.ly/4guXp4Bk](https://p-qkfgo2.t2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/4guXp4Bk/22425ae3-05ae-4e17-b415-9b4bc90f646c.jpg?source=viewer&v=206e1ad347638e851fd52c3a24a04148 "Test")

Once you've done this, create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of your repo. Within this root directory, add your client token and application ID as seen below:
```
DD_RUM_CLIENT_TOKEN=<YOUR_DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN_VALUE>
DD_RUM_APPLICATION_ID=<YOUR_DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID_VALUE>
```

You'll want to replace ```<YOUR_DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN_VALUE>``` and ```<YOUR_DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID_VALUE>``` with your own client token and application ID values.

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 4: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- You should begin after a couple of minutes, you should begin to see RUM sessions and events within Datadog for the React Native RUM application you created
- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).
- If you're curious to learn more about React Native, check out the [Introduction to React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
